"""Validate CHANGELOG.md structure.

Usage:
    python scripts/lint_changelog.py

Checks:
    1. First section is [Unreleased]
    2. Exactly one [Unreleased] section
    3. No duplicate version sections
    4. Released versions in descending semver order
    5. No duplicate ### subsection heading within [Unreleased] or a release newer
       than SECTION_POLICY_CUTOFF (older releases keep their historical headings)
    6. In [Unreleased] and releases newer than SECTION_POLICY_CUTOFF, every
       ``###`` heading is a standard section, appears once, has content and
       follows the standard order (AGENTS.md "GitHub Release Policy")

Exit codes:
    0 — changelog is valid
    1 — structural error found
